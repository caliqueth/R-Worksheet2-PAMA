#The average income for tax accountants varies across different states in Australia. In Tasmania, tax accountants earn approximately $60,500, while in South Australia, the average income is $55,000. Tax accountants in Queensland have an average income of around $53,600, and in New South Wales, the average income is approximately $57,333. In the Northern Territory, tax accountants earn an average income of $55,500, while in Western Australia, the average is around $52,250.

#The accuracy of the average income estimate is very good for Tasmania, with a small standard error of about $0.50. In South Australia, there is a moderate level of uncertainty in the average income estimate, reflected in a standard error of around $2.74. Queensland's average income estimate has a higher level of uncertainty, indicated by a standard error of about $4.11. New South Wales has a significant level of uncertainty in the average income estimate, with a standard error of approximately $4.31. The Northern Territory has a notable level of uncertainty in the average income estimate, with a standard error of around $4.50. In Western Australia, the average income estimate shows a moderate level of uncertainty, with a standard error of about $2.66. Victoria's average income estimate has a larger degree of uncertainty, as shown by a standard error of approximately $5.24. The Australian Capital Territory, like Tasmania, has a very good level of precision in the average income estimate, with a standard error of about $1.50.
